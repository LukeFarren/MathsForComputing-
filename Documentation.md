## Unit 11: Maths for Computing. 



## **Part 1: A**

For part A both the Lowest Common Multiple and the Highest Common Factor has to be found for both eight and twelve. 

To find the Lowest Common Multiple we have to know the sequence of multiplication for both eight and twelve.

 **Multiples of Eight:**	

1 x 8 = 8        
2 x 8 = 16       
3 x 8 = 24       
4 x 8 = 32  

**Multiples of Twelve:**

1 x 12 = 12  
2 x 12 = 24  
3 x 12 = 36  
4 x 12 = 48  

Therefore, the Lowest Common Multiple of both eight and twelve equals 24. 

To find the Highest Common Factor we have to factor both eight and twelve.  

**Factors of Eight:**

1 x 8 = 8  
2 x 4 = 8  

1, 2, 4, 8

**Factors of Twelve:**

1 × 12 = 12  
2 × 6 = 12  
3 × 4 = 12  

1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12

Therefore, the Highest Common Factor of both eight and twelve equals 4.

Here is the application that was created using Euclid's algorithm calculating both the Lowest Common Multiple and the Highest Common Factor.

## **Part 1: B**

Using Euclid's Algorithm to calculate the Highest Common Factor of both 660 an 288.  

660 = (288 x 2) + 84  
288 = (84 x 3) + 36  
84 = (36 x 2) + 12  
36 = (12 x 3) + 0  

There for the Highest Common Factor for both 660 and 288 equals twelve.
